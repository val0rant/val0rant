- 👋 Hi, I'm @val0rant, also known as Francesco Valentini in the offline world.  
     I'm a 21-year-old Computer Science student who has always been curious about things happening in the IT world.
- 👀 I'm interested in Web Development, UX Design, Mobile Development and Data Science.  
     Furthermore, I'm curious to learn about Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Network Security (especially Cryptography).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write a good bio, besides less useful things like Web Development, MATLAB and Python. /s  
     So far I've gotten a few programming languages under my sleeve, namely Java, C#, C and MySQL.  
     I've learned some BASH scripting, which turns out to be very useful given I mostly use Linux as my daily driver.  
     I have even tried out that madness called Assembly, albeit for a short while.
- 💞️ I'm not currently looking to collaborate on any projects outside of curricular, university ones... But let's see in the future!
- 📫 You can reach me out on Telegram, just send a DM to @val_0rant
